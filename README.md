## Philosophy

> "Ship beats perfect" - I build tools to solve real problems, then share them with the world. Whether it's APIs that help fintech companies validate bank accounts, platforms that make money transfers easier for immigrants, or books that preserve cultural heritage—my work is driven by impact and purpose.

I believe in the power of open source to create accessible solutions that benefit communities worldwide, especially diaspora populations and low-resource language speakers.
